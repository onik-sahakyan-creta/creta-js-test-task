# Test Task(JS-Intern): React App with Metamask Integration and Live DAI Transactions

### Objective:
Create a React application that allows users to connect their Metamask wallet and displays live DAI transactions. The transaction box should include the sender's address, receiver's address, transaction hash, and the block number.

### Requirements:

1. The React application should be created using Create React App or a similar tool.
2. The application should have a user interface that allows users to connect their Metamask wallet.
2. Once the user connects their Metamask wallet, the application should fetch and display live DAI transactions.
3. The transaction box should include the following information for each transaction:
Sender's address
Receiver's address
Transaction hash
Block number
3. The live transactions should be updated in real-time as new transactions occur.
4. Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) and React best practices.
5. Use any CSS framework or styling approach of your choice for a clean and presentable user interface.

### Instructions:

1. Create a new repository.
2. Set up a new React application using Create React App or a similar tool.
3. Create the necessary components and files for the application.
4. Implement the Metamask integration feature, allowing users to connect their wallets.
5. Fetch live DAI transactions using a suitable API or library.
6. Display the live transactions in a transaction box, with each transaction showing the required information.
7. Ensure that the live transactions are updated in real-time.
8. Commit your code regularly, with clear and concise commit messages.
9. Once completed, push the code to a public repository on GitHub.
10. Share the repository link.

## Evaluation Criteria:

1. Correct implementation of the Metamask integration feature.
2. Accurate fetching and display of live DAI transactions.
3. Proper organization and structure of the React components.
4. Real-time updates of the transaction box as new transactions occur.
5. Clean and readable code following JavaScript and React best practices.
6. Overall user interface and design.

Note: Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you find suitable for this task. Good luck!
